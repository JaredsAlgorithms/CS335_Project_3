# CS335_Project3

Project for CS 335 Project 3
Please note, this project does not read in data from a file, the data is imported manually to a `std::map`, as seen in both solutions.
Running time complexities also ignore file ingestion operations for final result.

# Compiling

## Algorithm 1

```
cd solutions
clang++ algorithm_one.cpp -o algorithm_one
./algorithm_one
```

## Algorithm 2

```
cd solutions
clang++ algorithm_two.cpp -o algorithm_two
./algorithm_two
```
